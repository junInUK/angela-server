This is a project to let people help each other and fight to COVID-19.

## Background Information
As the COVID-19 has seriously damaged humanâ€™s lives and the economy. Lots of families are losing their lovers, lots of isolating people need help but lots of key workers feel tired when they fight with the virus for long hours. To reduce the burden of our key workers, lots of volunteers stand out and say they can help. But how do the volunteers know who needs help, where are them and what kind of needs are? Here we can build an app to do this job.

## This repository is the part of the server side.
